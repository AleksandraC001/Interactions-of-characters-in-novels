Kitty interjects with her own question about the ball, while Mrs. Bennet expresses her concerns about not knowing Mr. Bingley herself. Mr. Bennet humorously acknowledges the insufficiency of a fortnight's acquaintance to truly know a man, but still decides to take it upon himself to make the introduction.
