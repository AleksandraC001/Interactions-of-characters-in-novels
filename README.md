# Book Text Processing and Character Analysis 

## Overview
This project provides two advanced methods for processing book texts and analyzing character interactions:

1. **LLM-based Analysis**: Uses Groq's Language Model to summarize character interactions
2. **BookNLP-based Character Tracking**: Utilizes BookNLP for detailed character mention and interaction tracking


## Method 1: LLM Character Interaction Analysis
### Prerequisites
- Google Colab account
- Groq API key

### Setup
1. Download the LLMbookProcessor file from this GitHub repository. This file contains all the necessary code for processing and analyzing book data.
2. Upload the downloaded file to your Google Colab environment.
3. In Google Colab, go to the "Secrets" section (found in the sidebar) and set your GROQ_API_KEY. This key is required for authenticating and accessing the API used in the code.
4. Run the code to execute the method.

### Key Components
- Chunk-based text analysis
- Character interaction summarization
- Uses Groq's Mixtral-8x7b model for analysis


## Method 2: BookNLP Character Tracking
### Prerequisites
- Google Colab account

### Setup
1. Download the BookNLPcharTracker file from this GitHub repository. This file contains all the necessary code for processing and analyzing book data.
2. Upload the downloaded file to your Google Colab environment.
3. Run the code to execute the method.

### Key Features
- Comprehensive character mention tracking
- Paragraph and sentence-level character analysis
- Canonical name resolution
- Chronological mention tracking
